## üí° Notes
# JWT Authentication: The app uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authenticating users. After logging in, users receive a token that they must include in the Authorization header for protected routes.
# MongoDB: The app is connected to a MongoDB database. Make sure to have MongoDB running locally or use a cloud service like MongoDB Atlas.
# Redux: State management is handled by Redux for seamless global state handling (e.g., authentication state, user data, etc.).
